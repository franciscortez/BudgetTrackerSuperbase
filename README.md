## 🎨 Design Guidelines

### Pink Color Palette

```css
/* Custom PennyWings Palette */
--pink-50: #fff0f5;   /* Lavender Blush - Backgrounds */
--pink-100: #ffe4e9;  /* Very Light Pink - Cards */
│                     ...
--pink-500: #ff7a93;  /* Deep Pink - Accents */
--pink-600: #e85d7a;  /* Rose - Primary CTAs */
```

### UI Patterns
- **Glassmorphism**: Components feature white backdrops with 80% opacity and subtle backdrop blur.
- **Animations**: Page transitions and button interactions utilize the `Motion` alias for Framer Motion.
- **Icons**: Branded Lucide icons styled with custom colors and opacity levels.

## ⚡ Performance & Optimization

PennyWings is engineered for speed and responsiveness through several key architectural decisions:

- **Code Splitting**: Routes are lazy-loaded using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`, reducing the initial bundle size and speeding up the first meaningful paint.
- **TanStack Query (React Query) v5**: Implements sophisticated caching, background data fetching, and optimistic updates to eliminate redundant network requests.
- **Atomic Balance Updates**: Uses Supabase RPC (Stored Procedures) to handle complex financial logic on the server, ensuring data integrity and reducing client-side processing.
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Leverages Supabase Realtime to keep the UI in sync across multiple devices without manual page refreshes.
- **Asset Optimization**: Uses SVG sprites and optimized PNG assets to minimize load times.

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is hosted on **Netlify** with continuous deployment.

1. **Build command**: `npm run build`
2. **Publish directory**: `dist`
3. **SPA Redirects**: Handled via `netlify.toml` for React Router compatibility.
