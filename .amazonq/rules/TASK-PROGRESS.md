### [Task Name] - [Date]
```
 
### Pagination Error Handling & Safety Checks - 2026-03-19
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Implemented a robust pagination safety check in `Transactions.jsx`. The system now automatically detects if a user is on an empty page (due to manual URL entry or data deletion) and silently redirects them to the nearest valid page. This prevents "No entries found" states when data exists on other pages.

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `src/pages/Transactions.jsx` (Added redirection logic and memoized handlers)

**Outcome:**
- Users requesting out-of-bounds pages (e.g., `?page=99`) are automatically redirected to `totalPages`.
- Deleting the last item on a page now correctly transitions the user to the previous page.
- URL state remains synchronized with valid server data.

### Premium Design Restoration & Framer Motion Integration - 2026-03-19
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Restored original premium design elements (pink gradients, decorative blur spots, overlays) that were lost during earlier refactoring. Integrated Framer Motion across all pages and components for smooth transitions and interactive micro-animations. Standardized the `Motion` alias for `motion/react` to resolve linting conflicts.

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `src/components/accounts/TotalBalance.jsx` (Restored pink gradient and spots)
- `src/components/accounts/AccountWizard.jsx` (Restored 3-step logic and layout)

- `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner.jsx` [NEW] (Resolved build error)
- `src/index.css` (Added global page transitions)

**Outcome:**
- Zero lint errors (`npm run lint` passed).
- All "wow" design factors restored while maintaining new animation capabilities.
- Modernized, interactive UX with high design fidelity.

### Infrastructure: React Query Integration - 2026-03-18
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Integrated TanStack Query (React Query) v5 to manage asynchronous server state. Refactored all data-fetching hooks to use `useQuery` and `useMutation`, significantly improving caching, background synchronization, and UI responsiveness.

- `src/App.jsx` (Added QueryClientProvider)
- `src/hooks/useBankCards.js` (Refactored to use useQuery)

- `src/hooks/useDashboardData.js` (Refactored to use useQuery)
- `src/hooks/useCategories.js` (Refactored to use useQuery)
- `package.json` (Added @tanstack/react-query)

**Outcome:**
- Eliminates manual loading/error state management in components.

## 🚧 Known Issues & Blockers

**No known issues or blockers at this time**

## 📌 Important Decisions & Assumptions

### Assumptions

- Users will primarily access the app via web browser
- Free tier Supabase limits are sufficient for MVP (500MB DB, 1GB storage)
- Single currency support initially (can be extended later)
- Monthly budget cycles (not custom date ranges initially)
- Users will manually input transactions (no bank API integration in MVP)
- Each transaction can be linked to one bank card OR one e-wallet OR cash (mutually exclusive)

### Technical Decisions

- Using Context API for state management (no Redux/Zustand needed initially)
- React Router v6 for navigation
- Chart library: Chart.js or Recharts (to be decided in Phase 8)
- Date handling: date-fns for formatting and manipulation
- Form validation: Custom hooks or React Hook Form
- Real-time updates: Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Design Decisions

- **Primary Theme**: Light pink aesthetic throughout
- **Color Palette**:
  - Base: #FFC0CB (pink), #FFB6C1 (light pink), #FFF0F5 (lavender blush)
  - Accent: Deeper rose/pink for CTAs
  - Text: Dark gray/charcoal for readability
  - Cards: White or very light pink with subtle shadows
- **Dark Mode**: Muted pink/mauve tones with dark backgrounds
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Card-based UI for bank cards (swipeable on mobile)
- Minimal, clean UI focused on usability
- Color-coded categories for visual clarity
- Progress bars with green (under budget) and red (over budget) indicators

### Database Design Decisions

- Bank cards have optional credit_limit (only for credit cards)
- E-wallets have wallet_type for categorization (PayPal, GCash, Venmo, etc.)
- Transactions can exist without a linked card or wallet (cash transactions)
- Transactions have payment_method field: "cash", "card", or "ewallet"
- Only one of card_id or wallet_id can be set per transaction (mutually exclusive)
- Categories can be user-created or default system categories
- Soft delete for cards and wallets (is_active flag) to preserve transaction history
- Balance stored on both card and wallet records and updated via transactions
- RLS policies ensure users only see their own data
